# SkyblockSniper

### This is a BIN sniper bot I made in like 2 hours because all the BIN sniping people seem annoying
Presumably it's pretty badly made since I wasn't getting the "200 mil per hour" figures that the YouTubers kept spouting so feel free to submit pull requests

## How to use:
### Step 1
Download Python 3.7.8. There's literally thousands of guides on how to do this so I'll assume you can figure it out yourself.

### Step 2
Either download this repository or just copy paste all the code from inside `SkyblockSniper.py` into a new file on your computer called `SkyblockSniper.py`, and all the text from `requirements.txt` into a new file on your computer called `requirements.txt`.

### Step 3
Run the command `pip install -r <path to requirements.txt>`. For example, on my computer, the path to `requirements.txt` is `C:\Downloads\requirements.txt`, so I'd use `pip install -r C:\Downloads\requirements.txt`.

### Step 4
Run the file `SkyblockSniper.py` by going into command prompt (Window key + R, type cmd) and running the command `python <path to SkyblockSniper.py>`. For example, on my computer, the path to `SkyblockSniper.py` is `C:\Downloads\SkyblockSniper.py`, so I'd use `python C:\Downloads\SkyblockSniper.py`.

### Step 5
Now the script is running good and well. From here, you can just AFK on your island splitscreened watching Netflix or something. As soon as the script finds a good flip, you'll hear a low frequency beep for half a second, and the command to go to the auction is automatically put on your clipboard.

All you have to do is Ctrl+V every time you hear the beep, make sure it's not a scam (sometimes this happens with cosmetics or other market manipulation; can be prevented with NEU's average AH price thing), and then buy it.

-----------------

#### Some statistics I noticed
Timing: For me it takes 8-10 seconds to refresh the AH, which happens every minute (that's an API-level limit).

Coins per hour: There were a few good snipes per hour (i.e. a baby yeti for 1.6 mil, reaper mask for 1 mil) but again, no clue where the 200 mil per hour numbers are coming from. My best guess is that they're saying that SOME hours they make 200 mil per hour, and as such that means it's technically correct
